Overview
This repository contains solutions to algorithmic problems designed for the CS-2009 course. The problems are categorized into two parts, each addressing different computational challenges.

Part A: Problem Descriptions and Solutions
Problem 1: Counting Structures
Each type of structure consists of multiple stages, with each stage comprising a natural number of blocks. The task is to count the number of different structures that can be built from exactly n blocks, following specific constraints. This problem involves combinatorial counting and dynamic programming to efficiently compute the results.

Problem 2: Railroad Strategic Value
In this problem, Abdullah needs to strategically attack a linear railroad network to minimize its strategic value. Each depot on the railroad has a strategic importance, and Abdullah can attack between depots to achieve the minimum possible strategic value for the remaining railroad. The solution involves dynamic programming to optimize the attack strategy.

Part B: Problem Descriptions and Solutions
Problem 3: Minimum Not Presented Number (MNPN)
Laiba needs to divide an array into segments such that each segment has the same Minimum Not Presented Number (MNPN). The challenge is to determine if such a division is possible and, if so, identify the segment boundaries. This problem requires careful segment boundary selection based on the properties of MNPN within each segment.

Problem 4: Maximum Power Team Selection
Laiba aims to form a team of adventurers from M rows and N columns, selecting members in a strategic manner to maximize the team's power. Constraints include avoiding consecutive selections from the same row and ensuring that column indices strictly increase for each selection. The solution involves dynamic programming to compute the maximum achievable power efficiently.
